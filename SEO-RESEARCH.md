## SEO Technical Gaps to Fix

1. **OG images** — Currently using og-image.svg. Should generate unique OG images per tool (PNG, not SVG — some platforms don't render SVG OG images).
2. **Breadcrumbs JSON-LD** — Add BreadcrumbList schema to help Google understand site structure.
3. **FAQ schema** — Add FAQ JSON-LD to key pages (e.g., "What is a color palette?", "How to choose colors for a website?").
4. **Internal linking** — Each tool page should link to related tools. Currently minimal cross-linking.
5. **Footer SEO** — Add "Resources" section with links to content pages.
6. **Page speed** — Already fast (Next.js SSG) but verify Core Web Vitals.

## Key Insight

Coolors wins because of **15+ indexed tool pages** each targeting a different keyword cluster. They have a page for EVERYTHING — even fonts and collages (which aren't even color tools).

**Our strategy**: Build 5-7 more tool pages that target the highest-volume keywords we're missing. Each page = a new keyword we can rank for. We already have better design and UX — we just need the pages to exist.

The biggest bang-for-buck opportunities:
1. **Color Picker** (~90K searches) — we don't have one and it's insane
2. **Color Names/List** (~25K searches) — easy to build, massive long-tail potential
3. **Color Converter** (~30K searches) — we literally already have the code
4. **Tailwind Colors** (~20K searches) — devs search this constantly

Total addressable traffic from missing pages: **~165K+ monthly searches** we're not even competing for yet.
